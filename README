S.G. 2016-11-01:
As I started to describe the token syntax for the filter language in the documents quoted above, I realised that a formal platform-independent definition would be handy. I have thus described a suggested real number syntax as Extended and Perl-Compatible regular expressions, and added several tests to make sure that these expressions perform as expected. The tests/inputs/*.lst files contain a list of real numbers, with some marginal cases, against which each independent implementation and teh defining regular expressions can be tested.

The tests should run on any GNU/Linux system with GNU Make, Bourn shell, GNU textutils and Python package 'jsonschema' (https://python-jsonschema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) installed.
